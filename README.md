This list focuses on resources for learning Common Lisp, especially resources that I've found useful.

There are other Awesome Common Lisp lists that focus on other topics:
- [Libraries](https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl)
  - [Curated Libraries](https://github.com/vindarel/curated-awesome-cl) - Forked and updated from the above list.
- [Software](https://github.com/azzamsa/awesome-cl-software)

Contributions are welcome. Please read the [contribution guidelines](contributing.md) for details.

## How To Use
1. Get a Lisp environment.
2. Bookmark the [The Common Lisp Hyperspec](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html).
3. Download and work through a Lisp book of an appropriate level. Type the examples and play with the code. Feel free to switch books and try a different one.
4. Try out [Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/common-lisp/about).
5. If you get stuck, find an online community and [ask smart questions](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
6. Learn about [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/).
7. At some point, read your Lisp implementation's manual.

## Lisp Environments
You can run a Lisp implementation directly, but an editing environment makes the experience easier.
- Prepackaged environments
  - [Portacle](https://shinmera.github.io/portacle/) - A portable and multiplatform Common Lisp environment. It ships a slightly customized Emacs with SLIME, SBCL (a popular Common Lisp implementation), Quicklisp and Git. No installation needed, so it's a very quick and easy way to get going.
  - [Lispbox](https://common-lisp.net/project/lispbox/) - An IDE (Emacs + SLIME), Common Lisp implementation (Clozure Common Lisp) and library manager (Quicklisp), pre-packaged as archives for Windows, macOS and Linux. Descendant of "Lisp in a Box" [mentioned](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/lather-rinse-repeat-a-tour-of-the-repl.html) in Practical Common Lisp.
  - [Lispworks Personal Edition](http://www.lispworks.com/downloads/) - A non-Emacs based IDE for LispWorks Lisp, with some restrictions.
  - [Allegro Common Lisp](https://franz.com/products/allegrocl/) - Has a free [Express Edition](https://franz.com/downloads/clp/survey) IDE, and [training videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN36UrxtyNBJPaG0kmBJNRw).
- For advanced users
  - [Articulate Common Lisp](http://articulate-lisp.com/) - A HOWTO for putting together a Lisp environment, and has information on [useful libraries](http://articulate-lisp.com/project/abcs.html) and how to [structure projects](http://articulate-lisp.com/project/new-project.html).
  - If you're an experienced [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user, you can just install [SLIME](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) and a [supported Common Lisp implementation](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Platforms.html#Platforms). See the [SLIME manual](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/) for more details.
  - The Common Lisp Cookbook has more information about [installing an implementation](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/getting-started.html) using an implementation manager like [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell/wiki), or on Docker.

## Online References
- [The Common Lisp Hyperspec (CLHS)](http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/common-lisp.html) - _The_ language reference document for Common Lisp. Bookmark it now.

  - The draft is free, the standard isn't.
  - It's pretty much the same as the official standard, and some people prefer it to the CLHS.
- [The Common Lisp Cookbook](http://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/) - A list of useful Lisp recipes. Also contains a list of other online sources of CL information.
- [Common Lisp the Language (2nd Edition) by Guy L. Steele](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html) - A description of the Common Lisp language from just before it was standardized by ANSI. Don't use it as a reference.
  - [Cliki on CLtL2](https://cliki.net/Getting+Started) - Claims it has more useful descriptions of [LOOP](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/clm/node235.html#SECTION003000000000000000000) and [FORMAT](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/clm/node200.html) than the CLHS does.
  - [Stack Overflow on CLtL2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/108537/what-are-the-main-differences-between-cltl2-and-ansi-cl) - Some recommend using CLtL2 for insight and inspiration, but to use the CLHS when programming.

  - [Chapter 28](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node260.html#SECTION003200000000000000000) - Covers the Common Lisp Object System.

## Online Books
These books that are freely accessible online, arranged roughly in order from basic to advanced:
- [Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation by David S. Touretzky](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/) - a good introduction for people new to programming. Contains code for really useful utilities like [DTRACE](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Lisp/dtrace/) and [SDRAW](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Lisp/sdraw/).
- [Common Lisp: An interactive approach by Stuart C. Shapiro](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Commonlisp/) - A textbook that teaches mainly through the use of exercises.
- [Practical Common Lisp by Peter Seibel](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) - A great introduction for experienced programmers, and tries to highlight from the very beginning what makes CL different to other languages.
- [Common Lisp Koans](https://github.com/google/lisp-koans) - Not exactly a book, but a set of koans to help you learn the language.
- [On Lisp by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) - A great book for intermediately experienced Lispers.
- [Let Over Lambda by Doug Hoyte](https://letoverlambda.com/) - An advanced book on Lisp Macros.
  - The first six chapters are available online.
  - [Comments on Let Over Lambda](https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/3actsc/let_over_lambda/) - Several people recommend that you be comfortable with On Lisp before reading this book, and that the start is slow.
  - [The chapter on closures](https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap2.html) - Has several non-trivial examples, and demonstrates the power of this feature.
- [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming by Peter Norvig](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp) - Has many interesting applications of Lisp, but is no longer a good reference for AI.

## Offline Books
These are books that you'll have to buy, or borrow from a library.
- [Land of Lisp by Conrad Barski, MD](http://landoflisp.com/) - A fun introduction to Lisp that uses comics and has you writing games.
  - Available as an [ebook](https://www.nostarch.com/lisp.htm). 
  - A couple of the LOOP macros are written `for x for y...` which you can change to `for x from 0 for y...` to make them work in SBCL.
  - Has an [errata page](http://landoflisp.com/errata.html).
  - Most of the book is entertaining and fairly easy, but gets hairy from about Chapter 18. It doesn't feel like later chapters introduce much, so I recommend switching to a different book at that point.
  - The Web server example in Ch 13, 19 and 20 will only work on CLISP, and needs the addition of HTTP response headers to render the HTML properly.
- [ANSI Common Lisp by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html) - Good as a reference, covers CLOS, and has several example program implementations.
  - Plaintext versions of [Chapter 1](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/acl1.txt) and [Chapter 2](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/acl2.txt) are available online.
- [Common Lisp Recipes by Edmund Weitz](http://weitz.de/cl-recipes/) - A great set of Common Lisp patterns.
- [Object-Oriented Programming in Common Lisp by Sonya E. Keene](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Programming-COMMON-LISP-Programmers/dp/0201175894) - An in-depth description of the CLOS, and shows how to use it with example applications.
- [The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales, Jim des Rivieres, and Daniel G. Bobrow](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744/) - Describes the CLOS Metaobject Protocol (MOP).
  - [Chapters 5 and 6 (available online)](http://metamodular.com/CLOS-MOP/) - The specification of a metaobject protocol extension to CLOS.
  - [Adam Tornhill on AMOP](http://www.adamtornhill.com/reviews/amop.htm) - Recommends reading Practical Common Lisp, then  Object-Oriented Programming in Common Lisp, and then AMOP.

## Credit
I got a lot of the information from [Rainer Joswig's Stack Overflow answer on learning Common Lisp](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7224914/1005039), and from the now-defunct Stack Overflow Documents site. The [Cliki's Getting Started](https://cliki.net/Getting%20Started) page was also invaluable.
